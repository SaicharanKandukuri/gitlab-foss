    [We are deprecating the certificate-based integration with Kubernetes](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/).
    The timeline of removal of the integration from the product is planned to happen in two steps, starting with milestone 15.0 and finishing in GitLab version 15.6.

    In 15.0, we plan to introduce a feature flag that will allow GitLab Self-Managed customers to keep the certificate-based integration enabled, it will be disabled by default. We plan to remove this feature flag together with the underlying code in GitLab version 15.6.
    The certificate-based integration will continue to receive security and
    critical fixes, and features built on the integration will continue to work with supported Kubernetes
    versions until the final removal in 15.6.

    For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, we recommend the use of the
    [Kubernetes Agent](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab. 
    We provide [migration plans](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent.html) in the documentation.
