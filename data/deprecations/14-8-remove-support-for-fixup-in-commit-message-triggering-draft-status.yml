    The use of `fixup!` as a commit message to trigger draft status
    of the associated Merge Request is generally unused, and can cause
    confusion with other uses of the term. "Draft" is the preferred
    and supported trigger for triggering draft status from commit
    messages, as part of our streamlining of the feature.
    Support for `fixup!` is now considered deprecated, and will be
    removed in GitLab 15.0.
